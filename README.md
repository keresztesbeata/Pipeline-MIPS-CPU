# SCS-Assignment-Pipeline-MIPS-CPU

Implementation of a 32 bit MIPS CPU, based on a Pipeline Architecture, with a set of complex instructions, and a small instruction sequence for testing purposes. 
The project is written in VHDL, developed using the Vivado Design Suite, and tested on an FPGA Basys 3 development board.
